Notes for Lesson 2 - Regression

    These lessons will teach how to build regression models

    Pt. 1 Tools

    Linear Regression: If you are attempting to predict a numeric value then this type of model will work well

    Logistic Regression: If you are trying to predict a category assignment this model will work well for you
    
    Pt. 2 Data

    Data visualization is a key step before building your model. It allows you to gain insight on the data you are working with.

    Normalize data before analysis

    Pt. 3 Linear

    Our linear regression is a least-squares regression that minimizes the error between all of the points by fitting the line in a spot that
    has the least cumulative distance from all of the points

    Correlation Coefficient: A scatterplot of the datapoints in a straight line would have a high correlation Coefficient and the more scattered the points are
    the lower the correlation Coefficient.
