Notes for Lesson 1-Introduction:

    Pt. 1 Intro to ML:

        Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning:

            Machine Learning - A portfolio of statistical algorithms that look at your data and learn something to make a prediction.

            AI - The application that is built on top of the ML models. The results of a deployed model.

            Deep Learning - A type of more advanced ML. Not different just more specific.

        Introduction to Machine Learning - MIT's John Guttag

            Machine Learning - "Computers Learning without being explicitly programmed" - Arthur Samuel (1959)

            Traditional Programming:

                Data    ->
                            Computer -> Output
                Program ->
            
            Machine Learning:

                Data    ->
                            Computer -> Program
                Output  ->

            How are things learned

                Memorization:

                    Accumulation of individual facts

                    This is declarative knowledge

                Generalization:

                    Deduce new facts from old facts

                    This is imperative knowledge

                In ML we are seeking generalization

            Supervised Learning:

                Given a set of feature/label pairs, find a rule that predicts the label associated with a previously unseen input

            Unsupervised Learning:

                Given a set of feature vectors (without labels) group them into "natural clusters" (or create labels for groups)

            Feature Engineering:

                What are the features in my dataset and how do I weight those features to create the optimal model?

            Manhattan Distance:

                Given points (x,y) and (x1, y1)

                Manhattan Distance = abs(x-x1) - abs(y-y1)

                Calculating this distance you measure the distance of moving only parallel to each axis and not taking the actual
                shortest straight route between each destination

                This would be useful for determining distance in a discrete space

            Euclidean distance:

                Given points (x,y) and (x1, y1)

                Euclidean Distance = ((x-x1)^2 - (y-y1)^2)^(1/2)

                Calculating this distance measures the shortest distance by moving directly to the destination with no turns

                This is useful for determining distance in a continous space

            Accuracy:

                The predictive accuracy of a model

                accuracy = (True Positive + True Negative) / (True Positive + True Negative + False Positive + False Negative)

            Positive Predictive Value (PPV):

                The accuracy of a model for positive predictions

                PPV = True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive)

            Sensitivity:

                The percentage of positive samples in the dataset correctly identified

                sensitivity = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)

            Specificity:

                The percentage of negative samples in the dataset correctly rejected

                specificity = True Negative / (True Negative + False Positive)

    Pt. 2 History of ML:

        1950 Alan turing laid the foundation for machines that can think

        1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project coins the terms Artificial Intelligence

        1956-1974 Researchers were confident in the future of the field and thought that it would progress rapidly

            Achievments in this period:

                First chat bot Eliza developed

                Shakey the robot

                Blocks world

        1974-1980 Confidence in the future of the field diminished due to overcoming problems such as computer power, exponential growth in required parameters
        paucity of data, the 'chinese room theory' brought into question the turing test, the ethics of introducing AI into society was questioned

            Paradigm forms between scruffy vs. neat AI. Scruffy AI had researchers develop algorithms and special case solutions for each problem to produce
            intelligent behaviour while neat AI tried to find a more general approach to developing intelligence that can be iterated and improved upon to achieve
            general intelligence or superintelligence. After the 90's neat became the almost exclusively used approach.

        1980s Expert Systems

            Businesses began to use the first successful forms of AI known as expert systems which utilized a rules engine for business requirement and an inference
            system that used rules to deduce new facts.

        1987-1993 AI Chill

            AI systems were less commonly used in this time period but the start of personal computing opened up the development of big data in the future

        1993-2011 Problems caused by lack of computing power and lack of data were starting to be overcome in this time period and it caused rapid development of
        the field again.

        Now AI is part of our everyday lives and the ethics of using AI is now a much larger issue that needs addressed
